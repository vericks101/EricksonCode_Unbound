I can't help myself staring into space because of it's beauty; just like the items I have to sell! Take a look...
Why do I stand up here on this balcony area day and night you ask? What a simple question... The answer is that it makes me look cool... Right?
Hey do you like video games? I like video games... Especially this one where you get to fight as a team of four heros. What was it called again... Something with Fantasy in the title.
I can't imagine there are any vendors here that could possibly sell items that are worth more than the ones I have to offer. You should take a look; I Promise you won't be disappointed!
