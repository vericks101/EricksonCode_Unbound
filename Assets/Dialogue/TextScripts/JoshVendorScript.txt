Hey, what are you doing blocking my hallway huh? I'm just kidding, hey don't take it so seriously, it was just a joke...
Hey wanna hear a joke? Oh wait nevermind most of my jokes are too inappropriate, I'd probably get in trouble haha.
Man, those aliens just don't know when to give up... Even being an ex-marine I can't deal with them. There are way too many but don't think I've given up hope, I'm just taking a break, that's all...
You learn alot from being a marine. I served my country for many years but I never imagined there would be a day where we would have to fight off aliens... Oh well as long as I get to exterminate them, I'll be fine!
Man it kind of sucks being stuck in this place without my phone. I forgot it when we all scrammed for safety. If I had my phone right now I'd be entertaining myself with this one game. I forgot the name though but I remember it having something to do with Clans. Man it's a fun game...
