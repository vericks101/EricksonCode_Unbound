Hey, what's up?
Hey do you like video games? I love video games. One of my favorites is this one where there is a single man in a suit of armor that takes on an army of aliens. Now that I think of about it, it could be sort of similar to this situation... Haha.
Hey what do you like to do in your freetime? I love to create video games infact I'm sort of an indie developer... that is before this all happened. I hope that one day things will go back to normal.
